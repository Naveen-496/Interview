   Functional Interface: An interface with just one abstract method. And it can have one or more default or static methods in it.
   ** Lambdas can only be used in the context of a Functional Interface.

 * Lambda Expression : A lambda expression is an anonymous function (a function without a name) that can be used to implement a functional interface (an interface with only one abstract method). It allows writing inline implementations without creating a separate class. 
 * 
 * Syntax: 
 * (parameters) -> { expression/body }

 * Functional Interface (Prerequisite for Lambdas): 
    A functional interface is an interface with only one abstract method. Java provides built-in functional interfaces in java.util.function, such as Consumer<T>, Supplier<T>, Predicate<T>, and Function<T, R>, BiConsumer<T, K>, BiPredicate<T, B>, BiFunction<T, R, S>.

    There are a lot of functional interfaces in the java.util.function package. The more common ones include, but are not limited to:

    Function ‚Äì it takes one argument and returns a result
    Consumer ‚Äì it takes one argument and returns no result (represents a side effect)
    Supplier ‚Äì it takes no arguments and returns a result
    Predicate ‚Äì it takes one argument and returns a boolean
    BiFunction ‚Äì it takes two arguments and returns a result
    BinaryOperator ‚Äì it is similar to a BiFunction, taking two arguments and returning a result. The two arguments and the result are all of the same types.
    UnaryOperator ‚Äì it is similar to a Function, taking a single argument and returning a result of the same type
 * 
 * 
 * Why Use Lambda Expressions?
‚úÖ Reduces boilerplate code
‚úÖ Makes code more concise and readable
‚úÖ Enhances functional programming in Java
‚úÖ Works seamlessly with Streams and Collections

 * 
 * üìå Differences Between Streams and Collections in Java
 * Both Streams and Collections are used for working with groups of objects, but
 * they serve different purposes and have key differences in their behavior.
 * 
 * 1Ô∏è‚É£ Definition & Purpose
 * Feature Collections Streams
 * Definition:
 * A data structure that stores elements in memory.
 * A sequence of elements processed functionally.
 * Purpose :
 * Designed for storing, modifying, and accessing data.
 * Designed for data processing and transformations.
 * Mutability:
 * Allows modification (add, remove, update).
 * Immutable (does not modify source data).
 * 
 * 2Ô∏è‚É£ Storage vs Computation
 * Storage:
 * Stores elements in memory.
 * Does not store elements (operates on demand).
 * Access:
 * Elements can be accessed randomly via index (like list.get(0)).
 * Elements are accessed sequentially in the pipeline.
 * 
 * 3Ô∏è‚É£ Eager vs Lazy Evaluation
 * Processing:
 * Processes elements immediately (eager evaluation).
 * Processes elements lazily (operations execute only when a terminal operation
 * is invoked).
 * 
 * 4Ô∏è‚É£ Modification and Mutability
 * Modifiable:
 * Supports add(), remove(), set(), etc.
 * Immutable, cannot modify the source.
 * Reusability Can be iterated multiple times. Can be used only once.
 * 
 * 5Ô∏è‚É£ Parallel Processing
 * Parallel Execution:
 * Not built-in (requires explicit threading).
 * Supports parallelStream() for parallel execution.
 * 
 * 6Ô∏è‚É£ Traversal Mechanism
 * Iteration:
 * Uses forEach, iterators, or loops.
 * Uses functional programming operations (map(), filter(), etc.).
 * Direction:
 * Supports bidirectional traversal (ListIterator).
 * Supports only one pass through the data.
 * 
 * 7Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Considerations
 * 
 * Memory Efficiency:
 * Stores all elements in memory.
 * Uses on-demand processing (saves memory).
 * Performance:
 * Can be efficient for small data.
 * Optimized for large data processing (can be parallelized).
