Garbage Collection in java is an automatic memory management process that reclaims memory 
occupied by objects that are no longer in use.

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) handles garbage collection, relieving developers from manually
allocating and deallocating memory.

The process involves identifying and marking objects that are no longer reachable or referenced 
by the program. These unreachable objects are then considered garbage and are removed from memory,
freeing up memory for new objects.

Different algorithms exists.

1. Mark and Sweep:
    Marks reachable objects and then sweeps away unmarked ones.

2. Generational:
    Divides memory into generations ( young and old ) and collects garbage
    more frequently in younger generations where objects are more likely to become garbage.
